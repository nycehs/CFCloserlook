View online via Github Pages at https://nycehs.github.io/Data-Story-Development/Index.html

To ready for deployment, add Google Analytics code to the header of a story, and then copy the story's folder into [Closerlook-Deployment repository](https://github.com/nycehs/Closerlook-Deployment/tree/master).

Remove folders from this repo once the data stories are live.

Testing our autocommit and automated tasks.
